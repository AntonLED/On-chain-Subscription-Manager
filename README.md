# On-chain-Subscription-Manager

A smart contract system for recurring payments (subscriptions) on the Ethereum
network. Users create and activate subscriptions, and the service automatically
charges ERC-20 tokens according to a predefined schedule.

The contract is designed to ensure transparency, security, and resilience
against merchant abuse.
